Group project for the Year 1 Semester 2 CI453 Cybersecurity group project. 

****************************

As a group we decided to leave the the website to me while the other group members assisted with the research and group report. 

The goal was to create an educational website appropriate for an age group of 11-14.

There is also a quiz which pulls from a list of 40 questions, the same question won't get asked twice so you can do it four times before the list resets. The position of answers was also randomised.
